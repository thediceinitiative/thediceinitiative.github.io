# Service, redefined.

The DICE Initiative is College Park High School's premier entrepreneurship club. We work closely with our community to bring fresh talent to the Greater Houston business scene.

DICE connects high school students with local businesses to complete service projects in the fields of marketing, software development, and business management. 
Members sharpen their own skills through real-world experience while selflessly serving small businesses and nonprofit organizations. This personal hometown connection drives the quality of the work we complete today.

Since 2020, DICE has partnered with and completed projects for nearly three dozen organizations. Our mission is simple: help students develop both the acute skillset and altruistic drive necessary to succeed in the modern entrepreneurial age.


## About DICE

The DICE Initiative is powered by [MIT LaunchX](https://launchx.com/).

From 2017 to 2020, DICE acted as an incubator, preparing teams to enter hypothetical business models into the University of Delaware’s annual Diamond Challenge. However, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on local businesses inspired our board to rewire DICE into a community service organization. Members are now able to sharpen their own skills through real-world experience while selflessly serving small businesses and nonprofit organizations.

## Our Model

DICE members form marketing, software development, and business management teams. Each team partners with an organization they have the skillset to help and are interested in. Teams complete projects during the school year and present their work at a celebratory springtime gala.

Students love DICE because they get to see the impact of their hard work in real time. Many teammates become lifelong coworkers and friends and some teams are still in touch with their partner organization to this day!

## Behind the Scenes

DICE is an entirely student-led organization. Our VP of Marketing leads promotion and member recruitment throughout the year, our VPs of Outreach spend their summers meeting with prospective sponsors, speakers, and partner organizations, and all of our VPs maintain supportive administrative positions. Our Category Leads work closely with DICE teams during the school year, meeting with each of their teams weekly and providing invaluable advice, instruction, and insight. The President oversees all projects and handles all administrative work.
