# Service, redefined.

The DICE Initiative is College Park High School's premier entrepreneurship club. We work closely with our community to bring fresh talent to the Greater Houston business scene.

DICE connects high school students with local businesses to complete service projects in the fields of marketing, software development, and business management.

Since 2020, DICE has partnered with and completed projects for nearly two dozen organizations. Our mission is simple: help students develop both the acute skillset and altruistic drive necessary to succeed in the modern entrepreneurial age.


## About DICE

The DICE Initiative is powered by [MIT LaunchX](https://launchx.com/).

From 2017 to 2020, DICE acted as an incubator, preparing teams to enter hypothetical business models into the University of Delawareâ€™s annual Diamond Challenge. However, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on local businesses inspired our board to rewire DICE into a community service organization. Members are now able to sharpen their own skills through real-world experience while selflessly serving small businesses and nonprofit organizations.
